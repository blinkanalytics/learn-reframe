## Instructions:

```sh
cd learn-reframe
lein figwheel
```

You'll be in the right place once you see:

Also note that this was going to be a much larger project at first, hence the many dependencies. However once I started testing out re-frame/devcards I realized I didn't really know what the hell I was doing but everything was somewhat self-documenting. So it's more of a document now.
